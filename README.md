# **Work in Progress**
# Hands On: AI-Driven Parkinsons Diagnosis
A workshop as introduction to Deep Learning and speach analysis.

During the workshops the participants will learn:
- The basic of neural networks, e.g. activation functions, loss functions
- The more advanced Recourent Neural Networks and LSTMs
- How to apply the gained knowledge to speach datasets

## Agenda
We recommend the following agend.

1. System Setup <br>
    You will need to bring your own laptop. There are two ways to run code during the workshop.
    a. **Locally** on your machine. There for you will need Python 3.6, Keras, and Tensorflow installed.
    b. **Azure Notebooks** You can run the code online over Azure Notebooks. https://notebooks.azure.com/
2. Introduction to machine learning
3. Introduction to deep learning
4. Apply it to the spoken digits dataset
5. Advanced topic: RNN, LSTM
6. Apply it to the Parkinsons Dataset
