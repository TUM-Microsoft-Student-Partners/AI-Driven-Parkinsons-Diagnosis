## Download Datasets

As we do not want to spend our time downloading the datasets for the workshop please download them ahead of time. In addition we do not own the datasets and have no right to distribute them.

1. [Free-Spoken-Digit-Dataset](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset)

2. [Parkinsons-Dataset](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4993293/wiki/247860): Please follow the instructions on how to gain access to the data. This might take some time, but is really important, as we are not allowed to distribute the dataset our selfs during the workshop.
